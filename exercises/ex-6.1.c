/* Compile the program in Listing 6-1 (mem_segments.c), and list its size using
ls â€“l. Although the program contains an array (mbuf) that is around 10 MB in
size, the executable file is much smaller than this. Why is this?

mbuf is part of the "Uninitialized segment" and thus need not to have allocated
space for its  data.
